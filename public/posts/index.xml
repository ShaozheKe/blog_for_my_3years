      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m just an ordinary undergraduate student in the School of Management and Engineering at Nanjing University, majoring in Industrial Engineering. To be honest, I don’t particularly enjoy most of what we learn in this program. As an interdisciplinary field, it involves a lot of things I can’t connect with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to this university wasn’t what I had envisioned, and not studying mathematics was something I regretted. I’ve wanted to study math since high school—not because I was head-over-heels in love with it, but because it was the only subject that could truly calm my mind. It was the only thing I could focus on deeply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
